** ( Understanding the Laravel Service Providers ):  

* ( What Are Service Providers? ):

- Service providers are the building blocks that prepare 
  and configure your Laravel application. 
  
  ensuring everything is ready for the Laravel Application
  to function properly


  ( Key Responsibilities ):
  • Binding services into the service container
  • Registering event listeners 
  • Configure base application components (e.g.. Auth, Database & etc...)
  • Configure Third-party packages components (which register themselves using "service providers")
  • Bootstrapping major setup tasks
  • Extending and modifying Laravel's core behavior
  • etc...

- When it comes to "third-party packages's components", 
  these components "register" themselves using 
  "service providers"

  which "allows" each of these "components" to "register"
  their own "bindings" & "configure themselves" in the
  "application lifecycle"

  to allow laravel to know how to setup everything



* ( The Two Main Methods, Under the "ServiceProvider Class" ):  

 1. {"register() Method"}

  ( Purpose ):
  • Used to bind services into the service container.
  • Called early in the request lifecycle.


  ( What NOT to do ):
  • It shouldn't contain complex logic.
  • You shouldn't try to use services that depend on other providers 
    here, because not all providers may be loaded yet.


  ( Key Point ):
  • The register() method is only for defining bindings
  • Don't assume the services you bind are “already bootstrapped.” Instead, 
    they are made available to be bootstrapped later when needed.



 ( Sample Code ):

 public function register(): void
 {
     // Simple binding - good
     $this->app->bind(PaymentProcessor::class, StripeProcessor::class);
     
     // ❌ Avoid - using other services that might not be registered yet
     // $cache = app(Cache::class); 
 }



 2. {"boot() Method"}

 - Execute logic after all providers are registered & is called 
   after ALL register() methods complete, 
   
   the sequence would be...
   → Laravel loops through all service providers
   → Calls the register method
   → Calls the boot method 
 
   meaning, its safe to use other services within the boot method,
   
   it's the right place for the logic that requires access to other 
   parts of the application



 ( Sample Code ):
 
 public function boot(): void
 {
   // Share data w/all views, all variables w/"$name" has the value Google
   View::share('name', 'Google');
   
   // Define route patterns, all values passed in this route, is filtered to integers
   Route::pattern('transactionId', '[0-9]+');
   

   // Method injection works here!
   public function boot(PaymentProcessor $processor)
   {
       $processor->configure();
   }
 }



* ( Built-in Service Providers Location ):

- Service Providers can be located under 
  their respective Service directories, 
  under the...

  vendor/Laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/...



* ( Creating Service Providers ):  

- there are cases where a "service container"...
  • may contain multiple bindings, under the register method
  • may execute multiple custom logic, under the boot method 
  cause a service provider to grow & bloated 

  in this case, we may need to "extract" bindings, custom logic,
  etc... into their own "service providers"


- we can do this by creating our own "service providers", 
  then extracting these "services" to that "service provider"

  CMD: php artisan make:provider *ServiceProvider_FileName
  /* Note: 
  1) Creating a Service Provider w/this command, 
     automatically registers the Service Provider,
     under the ...\bootstrap\providers.php

     if created manually, then the created ServiceProvider
     may be needed to be registered manually under the "path"

  2) The only time you would do this, is if you would 
     want to create your own custom service provider
  */



* ( Deferred Service Providers ):

- This kind of Service Provider is only loaded or registered
  when one of the services it provides is "called or needed"

  which can help in terms of optimizing the application performance,
  by delaying the loading of Services, until they are required


- The only case where you would need a "Deferred Service Provider",
  is when a "ServiceProvider" only "registers" components, into the 
  "Service Container"


  ( Code of Turning a Service Provider, into a Deferred Version ):  

  class *Service_Provider_Name extends ServiceProvider implements DeferrableProvider
{

    // Contains the bindings 
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->app->singleton(PaymentProcessor::class, function (Application $app) {
            return $app->make(Stripe::class, [
                'config' => []
            ]);
        });
    }


    // Returns the Bindings, Registered by "this" provider
    public function provides(): array
    {
        return [PaymentProcessor::class];
    }
}

** ( Differentiating Facades Design Pattern & Laravel Facades ):


* ( Facades Desgin Pattern ):

- Provides "simplified interface" to a set of 
  "complex classes / code" 

  The "goal", is to make a "subsytem" easier to use,
  by providing a "unified high level interface"



* ( Laravel Facades ):

- Provides a way to "access", "methods" of "classes",
  from the "service container" in a "static way"

  facades serves as static proxies, proxying status
  codes to the actual class methods
